## 🧱 Stage 1: Foundations of Statistics

### ✅ Topics:
- What is Statistics? (Descriptive vs Inferential)
- Types of Variables: Categorical vs Numerical
- Scales of Measurement: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio
- Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode
- Measures of Dispersion: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
- Data Types: Discrete vs Continuous

---

## 📈 Stage 2: Data Visualization & Summary

### ✅ Topics:
- Frequency Tables, Histograms, Boxplots
- Scatterplots, Bar Charts, Pie Charts
- Skewness & Kurtosis
- Outlier Detection (Z-score, IQR)
- Summary Statistics: `.describe()` in Pandas

### 💻 Tools:
- Python: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- R: `ggplot2`, `summary()`

---

## 🎲 Stage 3: Probability Theory Basics

### ✅ Topics:
- Sample Space, Events, Outcomes
- Classical vs Empirical Probability
- Union, Intersection, Complement
- Conditional Probability and Bayes' Theorem
- Independent vs Dependent Events

### 📚 Resources:
- Book: *Introduction to Probability* by Blitzstein (Harvard)
- Course: MIT OpenCourseWare – Probability

---

## 📊 Stage 4: Probability Distributions

### ✅ Topics:
- Discrete Distributions:
  - Binomial
  - Poisson
  - Geometric
- Continuous Distributions:
  - Normal Distribution
  - Uniform Distribution
  - Exponential Distribution
- Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
- Standard Normal Distribution & Z-tables

### 💻 Tools:
- Python: `scipy.stats`, `numpy.random`
- R: `dnorm()`, `pnorm()`, etc.

---

## 🔍 Stage 5: Statistical Inference & Sampling

### ✅ Topics:
- Sampling Methods: Random, Stratified, Cluster
- Point Estimation vs Interval Estimation
- Confidence Intervals
- Hypothesis Testing:
  - Null vs Alternative Hypotheses
  - p-value, significance level (α)
  - Type I and II Errors

### 🧪 Common Tests:
- Z-test
- t-test (one-sample, two-sample)
- Chi-square test
- ANOVA

---

## 📉 Stage 6: Regression & Correlation

### ✅ Topics:
- Correlation Coefficient (Pearson, Spearman)
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Residuals & R²
- Logistic Regression

### 💻 Tools:
- Python: `statsmodels`, `sklearn.linear_model`
- R: `lm()`, `glm()`

---

## ⚙️ Stage 7: Applied Statistics

### ✅ Real-world Projects:
- A/B Testing (e.g. in marketing or UI changes)
- Clinical Trial Analysis
- Predicting Product Defects
- Survey Analysis
- Quality Control in Manufacturing

### 📁 Datasets to Practice:
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)
- `seaborn` built-in datasets (e.g. `tips`, `iris`)

## 🎓 Stage 8: Specialized Fields

Choose a domain to go deeper:

| Field                 | Focus                                          |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Data Science         | Predictive modeling, ML, Python & SQL           |
| Psychology           | Experimental design, ANOVA, psychometrics       |
| Business Analytics   | KPIs, dashboards, financial metrics             |
| Biostatistics        | Survival analysis, clinical trials              |
| Industrial/Quality   | Six Sigma, Control Charts, SPC                  |

---

## 🧠 Bonus Tips

- Use flashcards (e.g. Anki) to remember formulas.
- Practice with real-world data weekly.
- Visualize everything — graphs reveal more than numbers.
- Solve short exercises regularly (e.g. from books or LeetCode Stats section).
