# 📊 Basic Concepts of Statistics

A foundational overview of core statistical concepts, including types of data, measurement scales, and descriptive measures.

## 🧠 What is Statistics?

**Statistics** is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.

### Two Main Branches:

| Type               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Descriptive Statistics** | Summarizes or describes features of a dataset (e.g. mean, median, charts) |
| **Inferential Statistics** | Makes predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample       |

## 📦 Types of Variables

Variables are characteristics or attributes that can vary among data points.

### 🔹 Categorical (Qualitative)

- **Nominal**: Categories with no natural order 
  *Example: Gender (Male, Female), Colors (Red, Blue)*

- **Ordinal**: Categories with a meaningful order 
  *Example: Education level (High School < Bachelor < Master)*

### 🔸 Numerical (Quantitative)

- **Discrete**: Countable values 
  *Example: Number of children, Defect counts*

- **Continuous**: Measurable values in a range 
  *Example: Weight, Temperature, Time*

## 🎯 Scales of Measurement

Measurement scales define how data is categorized and interpreted.

| Scale     | Description                           | Example                        |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Nominal   | Categories without order              | Eye color, Country             |
| Ordinal   | Categories with order                 | Satisfaction level (Low–High) |
| Interval  | Numerical, equal intervals, no true zero | Temperature (°C, °F)          |
| Ratio     | Interval + true zero                  | Height, Weight, Age            |

## 📌 Measures of Central Tendency

Used to describe the "center" of a dataset.

| Measure | Description                            | Use Case                      |
|---------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Mean**   | Arithmetic average                      | For symmetrical distributions |
| **Median** | Middle value in ordered data            | When outliers are present     |
| **Mode**   | Most frequent value                     | For categorical/numerical data|

## 📉 Measures of Dispersion

Describe the **spread** or **variability** of the data.

| Measure            | Description                                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Range**          | Difference between maximum and minimum values      |
| **Variance**       | Average of squared deviations from the mean        |
| **Standard Deviation (SD)** | Square root of variance — shows average spread    |

> Smaller SD → data is close to the mean 
> Larger SD → data is more spread out

## 🔢 Data Types: Discrete vs Continuous

| Type       | Description                                 | Example               |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Discrete**   | Countable values, often integers             | Number of students     |
| **Continuous** | Can take any value in a range, measurable    | Time, Distance, Salary |

## 🧭 Quick Summary

- Use **descriptive statistics** to summarize data.
- Use **inferential statistics** to generalize from samples.
- Know your variable types to choose the right statistical method.
- Understand **measurement scales** before coding or modeling data.
- Central tendency and dispersion give a basic picture of the dataset.
